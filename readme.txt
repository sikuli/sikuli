= What is Sikuli? =

Sikuli is a visual technology to automate graphical user interfaces (GUI) 
using images (screenshots). The current release of Sikuli includes Sikuli 
Script, a visual scripting API for Jython, and Sikuli IDE, an integrated 
development environment for writing visual scripts with screenshots easily. 
Sikuli Script automates anything you see on the screen without 
internal API's support. You can programmatically control a web page, a 
desktop application running on Windows/Linux/Mac OS X, or even an 
iphone application running in an emulator. 

More detail information can be found on http://sikuli.org
